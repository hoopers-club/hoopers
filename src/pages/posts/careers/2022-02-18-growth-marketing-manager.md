**About Hoopers:**

We want to turn the world into a huge basketball playground while energizing local communities through sports, urban art and music.

Hoopers is building the largest global basketball community that connects players, fans and enthusiasts through products, contents, experiences and NFTs. Basketball coverage and experiences are great in the United States, but suck in Europe. We want to change that by connecting the basketball community in a single environment: Finding courts to play, scheduling games with friends or creating on-court related content won’t be a problem anymore.



**About you:**

You love Basketball and Sports!

You are an ambitious and resilient person with passion for building something from scratch. 

Marketing (digital, performance and social media) runs in your blood. You know not only how to grow a business, but how to explode it. You feel comfortable in an uncomfortable environment, because you like to build things from the ground up. You know how to test and experiment new solutions, and fine tune them to excel.

You are a team player! Our story is something you want to be a part of.

* Collect data to build, test, iterate and make better business decisions in the different channels

* Prepare and monitor the marketing budget on a quarterly basis to allocate funds

**Requirements:**
