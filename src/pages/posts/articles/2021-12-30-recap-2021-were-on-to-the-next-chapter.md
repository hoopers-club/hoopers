**Another year has come to an end. The year of 2021 taught us how to walk, but in 2022 we just want to run. As fast as we can.** 

Here’s our annual & short recap:

* We grew our community! 
* We met and worked together with awesome talented people (and had a blast!)
* We built connections with new partners and strengthen relationships with old ones (the doors are always open)
* We renovated more basketball courts and even created new basketball courts from scratch (and saw this movement spreading in the country, which was great)
* We also gave an hand in few soccer courts ( you’re welcomed)
* We were in the local and international news in several occasions (thanks to all the press who was kind enough for sharing our stories)
* We celebrated Neemias Queta’s achievement big time in his hometown (more precisely with a +20 meters [mural](https://www.instagram.com/p/CR2C-DgBM1M/))
* We also hosted his very special [NBA Draft Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhLj-yavpI) (together with the community)
* We won the Best Sports [Podcast of the Year in 2021](https://podes.pt/vencedores/) (“teamwork makes the dream work”, right?)
* We also won the Best Lie of the Year Award (remember [this](https://hoopers.club/posts/articles/2021-10-12-hoopers-lan%C3%A7a-novo-campo-ic%C3%B3nico-no-canal-do-suez/)?)
* We entered in the Esports community (and even delivered a [ ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRrehnahxPi/)[physical event](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRrehnahxPi/) in style)
* We saw Lancelot returning and dropping a big [hit](https://open.spotify.com/album/6EhS1OTh45xjmt75lsuojx) to our community (and just wait for what is still coming soon)
* We attended and exhibited in our first Web Summit (and didn’t sleep much during those days)
* We released a new online store integrating Multibanco, MBWay and Paypal (because you’ve asked us for it)
* We launched a brand new and improved version of our website (available now in three languages)
* We released new collections of products (from [new products](https://hoopers.store/collections/todos-produtos) to [new collections](https://hoopers.store/collections/box))
* We opened our store for [community creators](https://hoopers.store/collections/bolas/products/hoopers-x-maze-005) (we’ll be pushing this soon)
* We grew our internal team to 5 people (but “unofficially” it’s way bigger than it)
* We inspired and helped others to start their own basketball projects in many areas of our sport (and that’s fuel that keep us alive)
* And we learnt a bunch!

But there were things that also didn’t work according to the plan. We made our mistakes and also got stopped by Covid on a few occasions, which forced us to postpone some projects and ideas.

Thank you to everyone we met, we worked with, we collaborated with, we partnered with, we learned from, we got inspiration from, we got help from, but especially to all of you who joined our community and will be changing the game along with us.

The future looks exciting and we are preparing new things (you know us).

The marathon continues. Godspeed.

**See you in 2022!**
