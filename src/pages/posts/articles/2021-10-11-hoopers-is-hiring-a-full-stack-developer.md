**HOOPERS IS HIRING A FULL-STACK DEVELOPER TO JOIN THE CLUB**

**About Hoopers:**

We want to turn the world into a huge basketball playground while energizing local communities through sports, urban art and music.

Hoopers is a basketball community platform for players and fans focused on leveraging courts, contents and products. Basketball coverage and experiences are great in the United States, but suck in Europe. It is difficult to find a court to play and also to engage with local communities. Players do not own a self-centered communication platform to express themselves and talk to their audience. Basketball products do not represent the community’s mindset and local identity. We want to change this paradigm, because fans are demanding a personalized and unique experience.

**About you:**

First, you have to love Basketball: you are a Hooper and you eat buckets for breakfast! 

You are an ambitious and resilient person with passion for building something from scratch.

You like to develop solutions that solve real problems and will be used in a real context. You are comfortable with learning new technologies, give your point of view, testing and experimenting multiple scenarios to find the right solution.

\
You are a team player! And you want to change basketball forever and have a strong impact on local communities.

**The Role:**

We are looking for a full-stack developer who loves web and mobile development. You will be a member of a growing and innovative startup where you will develop our tech stack and run experiments on different platforms.

Your role and position will be critical for the company’s tech development and your decisions and work will constitute the foundations of our scalable tech stack and roadmap. You might turn into our future tech lead or CTO.



You will be in the ideal environment to grow professionally while seeing your solutions being used by the community members.

**Responsibilities:**

* Create intuitive and user experience driven mobile/web applications and APIs
* Propose, build and develop the tech stack of the company
* Design, build and maintain efficient, reusable and reliable code
* Work on existing low-code solutions to improve their performance
* Run experiments with new products and web apps to test behaviors and interactions

**Requirements:**

* Basketball lover (former/current Hooper is a plus)
* Autonomous and responsible to commit with deadlines
* Creative thinking and imagination to do “magic” with limited resources
* Experience with web and mobile application development
* Experience in front-end technologies and developer tools
* Proficiency of English (Spanish is a plus)

**What do we offer?**

* Startup environment, where you can grow at the same time as you will be part of the company’s growth from an initial phase
* Compensation according to the agreed working model (full or, part-time, or moonlight)
* We’re remote-first

**Apply:**

Submit your CV and motivation letter to **info@hoopers.club**, with the following subject: **\[Application: Full-stack developer]**.
