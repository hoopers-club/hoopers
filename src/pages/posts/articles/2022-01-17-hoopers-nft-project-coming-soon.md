At Hoopers our goal is to build the largest global basketball community platform and you can be part of this story, or even better: own a piece of it.

</br>

After an intense year of many projects and learnings, we are starting 2022 with new, big and renowned ambitions. Our goal is to continue connecting the basketball community, and we will be entering the NFT (non-fungible tokens) space with unique collections built for and by the community.

</br>

We are preparing the release of our first drop of limited NFT items inspired by the projects we launched together with and for the community. But for starting, we would like to learn more about your crypto habits, tech savviness and NFT purchasing behavior in order to better serve your needs and preferences. For doing so, you can simply <u>[join our whitelist](https://form.typeform.com/to/PoG6KnXd)</u> and share some of your NFT experiences with us.

For André Costa, founder & CEO of Hoopers “we are a creative team always looking for disruptive ideas to serve the community and we are fortunate to work together with very talented minds and artists. The release of the NFT project is a natural step in our roadmap, but also a way to respond to the requests of our community. We want to make sure that our community feels part of our history, but also owns a piece of it”.</br>

Our roadmap will developed in different phases and NFT DROPS: Courts, Community and CryptoHoopers.
