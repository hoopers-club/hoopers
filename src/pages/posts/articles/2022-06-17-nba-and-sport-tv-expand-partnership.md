**LISBON**, June 17, 2022 – The National Basketball Association (NBA) and Sport TV, the leading pay TV sports broadcaster in Portugal, today announced a multiyear expansion of their existing broadcast partnership that will mark the most extensive NBA coverage ever in Portugal.

 

Beginning with the 2022-23 NBA season, Sport TV will air a record number of live NBA games each season and the league’s marquee events, including The NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2022, The NBA Paris Game 2023, NBA All-Star, the NBA Playoffs, the NBA Conference Finals and the NBA Finals.  Through the partnership, fans in Portugal will be able to watch weekend games in primetime as part of the league’s “NBA Saturdays and NBA Sundays presented by NBA 2K22” European primetime initiative, which features weekend games starting from 8.30 p.m. Portugal time. 

 

Sport TV will also air classic NBA games, original programming and NBA TV International, which offers non-stop coverage of all the action from more than 200 live NBA and WNBA games each season, the NBA G League, the NBA Summer League, the Basketball Africa League (BAL), daily highlights, live access to NBA events and press conferences, in-game statistics, and original and classic thematic programming.

 

“We’re excited to expand our partnership with Sport TV following a season that saw strong audience growth of the NBA in Portugal and the first Portuguese player in league history – Neemias Queta of the Sacramento Kings – make his debut,” said NBA Europe and Middle East Senior Director, Global Media Distribution Adam Cox.  “With regular weekend games in primetime and extensive coverage of the league across Sport TV’s channels, there has never been a better time to be an NBA fan in Portugal.”

 

“Portuguese fans will be able to watch the most games ever thanks to this expanded partnership between Sport TV and the NBA,” said Sport TV CEO Nuno Ferreira Pires.  “Thanks to the comprehensive schedule of weekend primetime games and a wider offer of NBA programming on Sport TV, this is the perfect time to become an NBA fan in Portugal.”

 

Earlier today, fans in Portugal had the chance to watch the Golden State Warriors win the NBA Finals 2022 live on Sport TV 1.  Warriors guard Stephen Curry was the recipient of The Bill Russell Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the Finals.
