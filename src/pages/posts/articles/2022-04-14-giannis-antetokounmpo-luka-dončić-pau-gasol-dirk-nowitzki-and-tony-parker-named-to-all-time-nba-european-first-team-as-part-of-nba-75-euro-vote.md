The All-Time NBA European Second Team consists of reigning NBA MVP [Nikola Jokić](https://we.tl/t-HooomRpBlf) (Denver Nuggets; Serbia), Hall of Famers [Toni Kukoć](https://we.tl/t-RbueQ2GTRm) (Croatia) and [Arvydas Sabonis](https://we.tl/t-ntaJcGXzdP) (Lithuania), NBA champion [Peja Stojaković](https://we.tl/t-enDUp5NDhH) (Serbia) and the late [Drazen Petrović](https://we.tl/t-wXxjA8UK8C) (Croatia).

The All-NBA European First and Second Teams were selected by fans in Europe and a blue-ribbon panel of more than 40 European media, broadcasters, influencers and celebrities.  The fan vote accounted for 50 percent of the final results while the panel made up the other 50 percent.

“European players past and present have made an indelible impact on the NBA and the game of basketball,” said NBA Head of Fan Engagement and Direct-to-Consumer for Europe and the Middle East George Aivazoglou.  “As we celebrate our landmark 75th Anniversary Season, [it is fitting ](<>)to recognize and honor the best European players of all-time, all of whom have inspired generations of players and fans across the continent and around the world.”

In previous NBA 75 Euro Vote categories, the 1995-98 Chicago Bulls were named the [All-Time NBA Dynasty](https://nbaworld.jebbit.com/uwq3umg5?L=Social&JC=Broadcasters), the 1998-99 Toronto Raptors away jersey won the [All-Time NBA Jersey](https://nba75.jebbit.io/jerseyes), and Nowitzki winning an NBA championship after leading the Mavericks back from a 2-1 game deficit in the 2011 NBA Finals was voted the [All-Time European Moment](https://nbaworld.jebbit.com/d6ewswda?L=Twitter).
