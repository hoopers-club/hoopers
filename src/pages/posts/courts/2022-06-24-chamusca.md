The** [Municipality of Chamusca](https://www.cm-chamusca.pt/)** and** [Hoopers](https://hoopers.club/)** are responsible for the sports and artistic intervention project, which included the participation of urban artist** [Vasco Costa](https://www.instagram.com/vascocosta/).**

Framed in the beautiful garden of the village is this 440m2 court, dedicated exclusively to the practice of Basketball and widely used by the local community for informal practice of this modality.

For **Cláudia Moreira** , Vice-President of the Municipality: “this project is another step in the requalification of sports and leisure spaces in the Municipality. We believe that this colorful space will be another good reason to visit our garden and also an invitation to the informal practice of Basketball in this colorful place”.

Urban artist **Vasco Costa** is responsible for the project. “I tried to frame and be inspired by this garden and everything that it contains, bringing to the countryside various elements that we can find in the surroundings, giving them an explosion of colors and shapes, which is very much my brand image. I am very happy with the final result”, says the artist.

This is another project led by Hoopers, which continues to accumulate initiatives for the Basketball community. “We are working on several fronts and preparing new things to continue serving our community. Regarding the courts, we will continue to develop this type of initiatives, which are fundamental to encourage formal and informal practice in the places, in addition to allowing the recovery of spaces”, says **André Costa** , responsible for Hoopers.

The space is now open to the public and an event will be held to mark its new colors at the end of July - date to be defined - to activate the local community of formal and informal practitioners. This project had the support and participation of** [JOPINTO](https://www.facebook.com/tintasjopinto/)** and** [Robbialac](https://tintasrobbialac.pt/) .**
