  From the streets to the world!


  Hoopers is focused on building the largest global community platform around the game of basketball. 


  We work together with local urban artists to transform old, abandoned and damaged courts into new and iconic spots in cities.


  Our goal is to bring the community back to the streets and inspire the next generation of talents to fall in love with our game.
