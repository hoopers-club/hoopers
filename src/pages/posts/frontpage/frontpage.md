  From the streets to the world!

  <br/> <br/>

  Hoopers is focused on building the largest global community platform around the game of basketball.<br/> <br/>

  We work together with local urban artists to transform old, abandoned and damaged courts into new and iconic places in the cities.<br/> <br/>

  Our goal is to bring the community back to the streets and inspire the next generation of hoopers to fall in love with our game.<br/> <br/>
