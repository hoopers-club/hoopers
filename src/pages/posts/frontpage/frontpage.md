  From the streets to the world!  <br/> <br/> Hoopers is focused on building the
  largest global community platform around the game of basketball.  <br/> <br/>
  We work together with local urban artists to transform old, abandoned and
  damaged courts into new and iconic spots in cities. <br/> <br/> Our goal is to
  bring the community back to the streets and inspire the next generation of
  talents to fall in love with our game. <br/> <br/> Check our projects and
