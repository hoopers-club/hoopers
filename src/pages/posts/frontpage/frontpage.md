  From the streets to the world!<br/> <br/>

  Hoopers is focused on creating the largest basketball community platform in the world.<br/> <br/>

  We work with urban art artists to transform old, abandoned and decaying basket courts into new, renovated and iconic locations for their cities.<br/> <br/>

  Our aim is to energize our community, revolutionize it and inspire the next generation of talent to fall in love with our sport and our way of life.<br/> <br/>

  Take a look at our projects and get to know their stories.
