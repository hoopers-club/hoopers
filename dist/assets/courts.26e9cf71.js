The goal is to bring the basketball community back to this area, which during the 1990s and 2000 was a regular spot to host 3x3 tournaments in the city of Lisbon. This initiative aimed at creating a new sports area to energize this area, while combining sports and urban art.\r

For Pitanga, invited artist for this project, \u201Cit was the first time I had the opportunity to develop a project on the floor. This is something I had in mind for a long time. My work is based on strong and bold colors, combined with shapes and figures. I tried to transpose my identity to the neighborhood and what I felt here: the constant movement, the people\u2019s interactions, the strength of local traditional commerce, the beauty of the green spaces and the Palace nearby.\u201D\r

\u201CThis space is very used by local community members who like to play informally here or just make a few shots. Its central location and basketball exclusive usage are distinctive elements of this court. The high temperatures made this project a difficult challenge, but the reactions of the local community gave us strength not to slow down.

The artistic intervention was done by SAMINA, who carried out his greatest work in terms of extension. This was also the largest renovation project done by Hoopers.

\r

It was also our first work involving other sports than basketball, which could open up new possibilities to access into other communities\u201D, explains Andr\xE9 Costa, CEO of Hoopers.\r

In the space, you can read the word \u201CBarreiro\u201D as well as the city\u2019s zip code \u201C2830\u201D. The court is open to the public and is free to use. The court is well identified with a big mural saying \u201CZona 4\u201D, where two figures are playing basketball and football. In the locker rooms area, visitors will be able to contemplate the faces of the 37 sports heroes honored in this intervention done by SAMINA.\r
\r
The project had the support of [Robbialac](https://tintasrobbialac.pt/), [JOPINTO](https://www.facebook.com/tintasjopinto/), [Sport Design](http://www.sport-design.pt/) and [Machrent](https://machrent.pt/Portal/).`,html:`<p>The Francisco do Pa\xE7o Sports Park, a local figure from Zona 4 in Barreiro, receives a tribute for 37 historical sports figures of this city. The artistic intervention was performed by SAMINA, covering a court, a mural and a locker room. Among the honored figures are names such as Fernando Chalana, Jo\xE3o Cancelo, Carlos Manuel, Manuel Bento, Mike Plowden, Miguel Minhava or Diogo Carreira, among many others.</p>
<p>As part of the initiatives to celebrate the municipality\u2019s 500th anniversary, this project promoted by Hoopers, a basketball community platform, and the Barreiro City Council aimed to honor some of the city\u2019s local sports heroes, while recovering and transforming a big sports area and encouraging its usage by the community.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/1.jpg" alt="Cr\xE9ditos: Hoopers / Malagueta"></p>
<p>The reopening of the space to the public took place on June 28th, in a ceremony hosted by Frederico Rosa, Mayor of Barreiro, young sportsmen from various local sports and clubs, as well as some of the local heroes that were honored with this intervention.</p>
<p>The artistic intervention was done by SAMINA, who carried out his greatest work in terms of extension. This was also the largest renovation project done by Hoopers. Three spaces were transformed, covering a total area with more than 1800 square meters: a sports court (with dedicated and exclusive areas for basketball and football), a mural and a locker-room, where the 37 athletes selected by the Municipality are featured.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2.jpg" alt="Cr\xE9ditos: Hoopers / Malagueta" title="Cr\xE9ditos: Hoopers / Malagueta"></p>
<p>For Frederico Rosa, Mayor of Barreiro, \u201Cthis intervention is the affirmation of the enormous sports quality of Barreiro and its people. With this intervention, we wanted not only to strengthen the connection of people to the city, but also to pay a tribute to some local sports heroes, while reinforcing and promoting the appropriation of public space by the population\u201D.</p>

The project was even more special for the artist because this court was located next to her grandparent\u2019s residence.\r

Penafiel and Hoopers, a basketball community platform, have joined forces and renovated two basketball courts in the city.\r

\r
\r
The <b>Quinta das Lages</b> field, renovated by Flix, gained a 3x3 court and it is located next to the city's main sports hub and a big scholar area, which should boost its use by the entire local community.\r

The second court, located in a residential area, received an intervention by Matilde Horta, an artist born in Penafiel. She redesigned the existing 5x5 court, which was quite used by the local community and basketball clubs during the lockdown period. The project was even more special for the artist because this court was located next to her grandparent\u2019s residence.\r

Cal\xE7ada de Carriche was the spot chosen to pay tribute to Kobe Bryant, the iconic player for LA Lakers who unexpectedly passed away in January 2020 following a helicopter crash. The chosen court was the one in Rua Andr\xE9 Gouveia, located on the border of Lisbon, Loures and Odivelas. The court is already open to the public, and the wall is the biggest one in the city displaying a street art piece (52 meters high).\r

The motto for [Hoopers](https://www.hoopers.club/) new artistic intervention project was celebrating team spirit and the Mamba Mentality, as well as Kobe Bryant. Hoopers has already put forth several similar initiatives, such as the Chicago court, in Chelas, and Europe\u2019s largest street basketball court, which is in Braga. Besides paying tribute to the Lakers legend, this third project aims to give praise to a place that connects three municipalities of the Lisbon district and is a significant meeting point to play street basketball.\r

H\xE9lio Bray, one of the ambassadors of brands such as DC Shoes or Loop, and [author of a tribute piece commissioned by Kobe Bryant\u2019s family](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBDvKo6HPYf/), was chosen to paint the court and what will be the biggest street art wall in the city so far.\r
\r
\r
\r
\u201CThis is very special to the community and us. Since Kobe\u2019s tragic death, we had this idea of paying tribute to one of our heroes, as well as celebrating the Mamba Mentality \u2014 which is associated with the resilience, hard work and irreverence personified by the Lakers legend \u2014 and positive values of sports, such as team spirit. This place always had the magical gift of bringing people together from different towns, classes and ethnicities. And that\u2019s why that, in addition to the tribute, this legacy will live forever\u201D, says Andr\xE9 Costa, co-founder of Hoopers.\r
\r
\r
\r
To H\xE9lio Bray, \u201Cthis was the largest project I\u2019ve ever taken part in, and it gave me the chance to show different sides to my work. The connection I felt to this tribute and the story of this place thrilled me from the very start. I\u2019m extremely happy with the final result, and I hope this project inspires the new generations\u201D.\r

This project fits in the artistic intervention strategy for Lisbon in terms of requalification of public places and sports areas, which kicked off with AKACorleone\u2019s intervention in Campo M\xE1rtires da P\xE1tria (2019), today a reference of street art and sport. \u201CThis is a strategy we\u2019ve been shaping in terms of appreciation of public space and promotion of sports activities, accessible and aggregative, where street art plays a pivotal role, which we feel today is absolutely crucial because of the pandemic, to create spaces for sports and artistic interventions\u201D, states Hugo Cardoso, coordinator of Galeria de Arte Urbana.\r

It all began in 1992, when Oliveira Donbell, better known as **"Maninho"**, arrived in Portugal from Angola and settled in Bairro dos L\xF3ios.\xA0 He brought with him the passion for Basketball, immortalized by the first hoop he hung on this court and the bull he painted on the ground, as a tribute to the legendary **Michael Jordan** team. Thus **"Chicago**" was born. This space quickly won over the local community and ended up becoming a meeting place for kids and adults to share their love of the game.

\r
\r
\r
Almost 30 years later, it was the success of the Enguardas Basketball Field, in Braga, with art by Contra, that triggered another Hoopers intervention. It all started with a phone call between the coach - Frederico Umbelina - and his former player - Andr\xE9 Costa, founder of Hoopers. Other members of the local community quickly joined the team: Paulo Maposse, better known in the world of music as Daddy-O-Pop, rapper and partner of Sam The Kid in his first group: Official Nasty.\xA0\r

\r
\u201CAfter talking to Fred (Frederico) and the first visit to the spot, we quickly realized the enormous potential of this court, not only because of its location, but mainly because of the energy of its community. We found a generation of players teaching the love of the game to the younger ones: this is the essence of Hoopers and our community \u201D, explains Andr\xE9 Costa, founder of [Hoopers](https://www.hoopers.club/).\r
\r
\r
\r
Daddy-O-Pop invited Sam The Kid to the already frequent visits to the court and, inspired by the magic of this artistic intervention and the bond between generations, they came together once again to compose the new single \u201CNot Just a Game\u201D by Official Nasty, the group that marked the beginning of the career of both musicians.\xA0\r

The artistic team invited to be part of this project was [Halfstudio](https://www.instagram.com/halfstudiosigns/), the duo formed by Mariana Branco and Emanuel Barreira, who develop creative projects with lettering as the central element. The message behind their murals and urban art interventions is always inspired by the community where the piece of art takes place and, therefore, in the L\xF3ios neighborhood court, it will be read the name by which \u201CManinho\u201D baptized the court: Chicago.\r

It all started with a phone call between the coach - Frederico Umbelina - and his former player - Andr\xE9 Costa, founder of Hoopers. Other members of the local community quickly joined the team: Paulo Maposse, better known in the world of music as Daddy-O-Pop, rapper and partner of Sam The Kid in his first group: Official Nasty.\xA0\r

\u201CAfter talking to Fred (Frederico) and the first visit to the spot, we quickly realized the enormous potential of this court, not only because of its location, but mainly because of the energy of its community. We found a generation of players teaching the love of the game to the younger ones: this is the essence of Hoopers and our community \u201D, explains Andr\xE9 Costa, founder of [Hoopers](https://www.hoopers.club/).\r
\r
\r
\r
Daddy-O-Pop invited Sam The Kid to the already frequent visits to the court and, inspired by the magic of this artistic intervention and the bond between generations, they came together once again to compose the new single \u201CNot Just a Game\u201D by Official Nasty, the group that marked the beginning of the career of both musicians.\xA0\r
\r
\r
\r
The artistic team invited to be part of this project was [Halfstudio](https://www.instagram.com/halfstudiosigns/), the duo formed by Mariana Branco and Emanuel Barreira, who develop creative projects with lettering as the central element. The message behind their murals and urban art interventions is always inspired by the community where the piece of art takes place and, therefore, in the L\xF3ios neighborhood court, it will be read the name by which \u201CManinho\u201D baptized the court: Chicago.\r

<p>It all began in 1992, when Oliveira Donbell, better known as <strong>\u201CManinho\u201D</strong>, arrived in Portugal from Angola and settled in Bairro dos L\xF3ios.\xA0 He brought with him the passion for Basketball, immortalized by the first hoop he hung on this court and the bull he painted on the ground, as a tribute to the legendary <strong>Michael Jordan</strong> team. Thus <strong>\u201CChicago</strong>\u201D was born. This space quickly won over the local community and ended up becoming a meeting place for kids and adults to share their love of the game. It has been like this for years and generations and is still like this today.</p>
