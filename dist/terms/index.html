                            <h2>Object and Scope of the Terms and Conditions</h2>
                            <br>
                            At Hoopers our main goal is to connect the basketball community.
                            <br>
                            We want to create an active community around basketball.  We do this by encouraging people to meet and play the sport but also, by sharing basketball contents, products, and endorsing the preservation of your local basketball sites and courts.
                            <br>
                            To achieve this, we have developed a platform that aims to connect the community by allowing users to map courts, but also to challenge other players and schedule games between your friends, colleagues or any other members that are part of our Hoopers Community.
                            <br>
                            We know that for our community to grow, we need more than the love for the sport and people who want to play basketball. It is essential that we provide information on all existing courts and create a culture of awareness around the importance of preserving your local basketball sites.
                            <br>
                            We can only archive this with your participation and involvement.  That is why we invite people and our registered Hoopers to map their local basketball courts in our platform, provide us information on the state of conservation and maintenance and help us to join efforts to invigorate those areas, and give them back to the local community, as a renewed space that can be enjoyed by all.
                            <br>
                            In our Platform you will be able to see and follow our court projects and better understand how they have been transforming and positively changing local communities, bringing them closer together.
                            <br>
                            You can also use our platform to follow basketball news from around the world and watch and engage with our basketball related podcasts and other interesting content.
                            <br>
                            In our Platform, you can also find the link to our online store, but also information about new products, contents and solutions we are building to connect the community and extract economic value from our own current assets.
                            <br>
                            These Terms and Conditions will explain how our Platform works and shall be read and interpreted with our <a style="color: #ffba00;" href="https://hoopers.club/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.
