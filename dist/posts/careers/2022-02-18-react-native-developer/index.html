<p>We want to turn the world into a huge basketball playground while energizing local communities through sports, urban art and music.</p>
<p>Hoopers is building the largest global basketball community that connects players, fans and enthusiasts through products, contents, experiences and NFTs. Basketball coverage and experiences are great in the United States, but suck in Europe.
